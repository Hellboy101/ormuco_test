This code provides a starting point. However, building a fully resilient, real-time, geo-distributed caching system is a complex task that would likely require a team of experienced developers and significant testing, especially to handle the intricacies of network failures, data consistency, and efficient geo-replication.

Normally, on a big scale I would have used CDN service with S3 to do this kind of feature.


Here's how it works:

You need a central server with an API which can provide a list of all possible caching servers to the clients. To maintain data consistency, every caching server is connected to a redis database. 

What needs to be improve:

- it needs to have sockets beetween central server and caching server to invalidate local cache when it is changed from another server
- I based client connection to caching server on ping time response but this can be improve (calculate geo coordinates or set a timeout to recalculate ping time response periodicaly).
